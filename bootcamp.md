## UW eScience Python Bootcamp: Fall 2015

- **When**: Sept 28-29, 2015, 9:00am - 4:00pm

- **Topics**: We will cover the following topics:
  
  - basic use of Python
  - essential scientific Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
  - version control and collaboration using Git and Github
  - effective approaches to structuring code, data, and analysis for
    reproducibility.
  
- **Cost**: $30, which partially offsets the cost of the space we are using
- **Registration**: we have space for 60 people; registration is
  first-come-first-served through [eventbrite (link coming soon!)]().

The bootcamp will be very hands-on, and students should come with their
laptops ready to work together on examples and breakout activities.
