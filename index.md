# 2015 UW eScience Python Seminar

Increasingly, scientific research in many fields is driven by computational
approaches to large datasets, but graduate students are often expected to pick
up these essential computational skills on their own. To help address this, UW
eScience is offering a fall quarter Python bootcamp and seminar, aimed at
helping first-year graduate students in scientific domains brush-up on the types
of tools that drive computational research.

This effort is a continuation of the Astro 599 and AMATH 500 seminar courses
which were offered in
[2013](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/vanderplas/Astr599/) and
[2014](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/vanderplas/Astr599_2014/);
in 2015 we are dropping the course number and offering this content through a
more informal weekly seminar.

The seminar consists of two parts:

Python Boot Camp: September 28-29, 2015

: On Sept. 28-29, 2015, we will offer a two-day bootcamp (9am-4pm each day)
  covering the following topics:

  - basic use of Python
  - essential scientific Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
  - version control and collaboration using Git and Github
  - effective approaches to structuring code, data, and analysis for reproducibility.

  The bootcamp will be very hands-on, and students should come with their
  laptops ready to work together on examples and breakout activities.
  Capacity for the bootcamp is 60, and the cost is $30 (which partially offsets
  the cost of the space we are using). **Space is limited**: please register
  through [eventbrite (link coming soon!)]().

Weekly Python Seminar: Mondays 3pm-4pm

: Throughout UW's 2015 fall quarter, we will meet weekly to hear from UW
  community members about the computational tools they use for their own
  research. More information on this will be posted soon!
